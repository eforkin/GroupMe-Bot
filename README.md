# Make it your own<a name="pull"></a>

## Pull the code to your local machine

Within terminal, change directory to the location where you would like the files to live, then run this command:

    $ heroku git:clone -a YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE

And then change directory into the new folder

    $ cd YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE

## Configure your local BOT_ID environment variable

Open the file `.env` from your local files in your text editor of choice.
Find where it says "YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE" and replace it with the ID of your new bot.

If you don't know what your Bot ID is, please refer back to [this](#get-bot-id) section,
where it is explained how to retrieve it.

If your Bot ID is 12345678910, then:

    BOT_ID="YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE"

becomes:

    BOT_ID="12345678910"
